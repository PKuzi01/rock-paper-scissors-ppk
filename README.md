I spent most of my day researching, writing up a breakdown, wireframing and setting up the project so that production is a lot smoother. I thought doing something like that would take a lot longer, but it didn't, at least for this project. I figure it would take longer if it were a bigger project but my persepective has changed on how far you can get if you had a channelled focus. The hack lies in controlled noise, and todays controlled noise of choice is watching Daria, although I did forget to take some breaks. I think I'm most excited for the styling, but I'm curious on how I'll do on the behavioural build of the project. I hope I can exhibit what I've learned on JavaScript.

Finally got started on the building! I got intimidated by the JavaScript, because I was trying go for the most sophisticated way of adding elements through JavaScript, which is admirable, but, girl, note to self: KEEP IT SIMPLE!! Get used to it, test the waters. Anyway. I had fun with the styling. It's giving bubblegum, country star, on-the-road Barbie, and I am having the time of my life! Next, I build the functionality for the dark and light mode (the toggle of the button), and then style it. And I have a feeling it's gonna give Starfire's older sister. I am excited. Overall, really good build day.

I built the dark theme for the site, and dare I say, very Starfire's older sister! I'm so excited for it, it looks so cool. I also started with building the JavaScript for the page and, boy oh boy, I may need to script this thing out first before I try wing it with my head. I often work well with a guideline, and the only guidline I have is an old build that was created around very different conditions. I will say though, I feel more confident with tackling JavaScript than I did before, and that gives me a feeling of relief. I know it's gonna be a frustraing build but I know I'll do well if I'm paitient with myself. I got this, I just need to know my limits, and take it step by step. I must exercise patience.

**cue tiktok sound** Oh Lord have mercy. Mmm mmm mmm, today drained me. BECAUSE IT DID! ALL BECAUSE OF FIGURING OUT THE ROUNDS FOR THE GAME! I sobbed halfway, but I did make some incredible progress. I figured out the player and pc choices and how to store them for a round to be played. A lot of UI fixes were done today, which made me think that maybe I shouldn't style things so early, but thinking about it again, I'm glad that that was the process, because the UI fixes take a lot less time than they would otherwise. So thumbs up to me. I'm glad I got this far. Truly, I'm proud of me. I'm a bit disappointed in myself because of my eagerness to finished things way ahead of time, but (with the help of some really cool support, you know who you are) I managed to remind myself that it's okay if I don't finish today, and that I need rest, because rest is good. Tomorrow, with fresh eyes (god willing, because lord knows I never get a good night's rest), I can finish it, and I'll figure out the stuff that's frustrating. Again, dub to me because I got this far! Yay me!

Dude, it's almost midday, and I finished it. IT'S DONE!!!! I COMPLETED THE ROCK PAPER SCISSORS!!! I realised that I had to separate my functions and look at how they flow into each other really carefully. I rewrote some stuff and it works! The counts aren't weird anymore, the score is functional, everything is flowing!!! EVERYTHING IS FLOWING!!! I made a wonderful game!!! I cried though. I'm really sad that there's nothing more to it. But I'm insanely proud of myself, I wrote that entire thing. I'm really happy. It's bittersweet, but I can look at this and nod to myself like "yeah dude, you killed it bro." I like it, picasso. BEEG DUB FOR THIS PORTFOLIO FOR REAL!!!!!!!

### <ins>Overall:</ins>
* Rating: 8/10
* Note to self: *First, rest is good, so do that often. Second, you have support, so rely on that more. Third, you have tomorrow, so trust in that more. Fourth, you are brilliant, so believe in that more. Lastly, help is never a bad thing, so ask for it more. You're doing great things bubs! Keep going!*
