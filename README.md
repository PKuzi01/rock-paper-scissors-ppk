I spent most of my day researching, writing up a breakdown, wireframing and setting up the project so that production is a lot smoother. I thought doing something like that would take a lot longer, but it didn't, at least for this project. I figure it would take longer if it were a bigger project but my persepective has changed on how far you can get if you had a channelled focus. The hack lies in controlled noise, and todays controlled noise of choice is watching Daria, although I did forget to take some breaks. I think I'm most excited for the styling, but I'm curious on how I'll do on the behavioural build of the project. I hope I can exhibit what I've learned on JavaScript.

Finally got started on the building! I got intimidated by the JavaScript, because I was trying go for the most sophisticated way of adding elements through JavaScript, which is admirable, but, girl, note to self: KEEP IT SIMPLE!! Get used to it, test the waters. Anyway. I had fun with the styling. It's giving bubblegum, country star, on-the-road Barbie, and I am having the time of my life! Next, I build the functionality for the dark and light mode (the toggle of the button), and then style it. And I have a feeling it's gonna give Starfire's older sister. I am excited. Overall, really good build day.
